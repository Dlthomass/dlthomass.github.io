Designing a structured layout that is easy to read and understand is required to format output.
Designing a structured layout involves column headings and variable alignment using spaces, numeric format, currency format, etc. This chapter aims to explain this concept utilizing example COBOL code to design column headings and align data names under the such headings. 
At the end of the chapter you are asked to complete a lab that practices implementation of the components covered.
A capability of COBOL data output formatting that is worth noting but not covered in this chapter is that COBOL is a web enabled computer language. COBOL includes easy and quick transformation of existing COBOL code to write JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) where the output is sub-sequentially formatted for a browser, a smartphone, etc. Frequently, the critical data accessed by a smart phone, such as a bank balance, is stored and controlled by z/OS where a COBOL program is responsible for retrieving and returning the bank balance to the smart phone.
