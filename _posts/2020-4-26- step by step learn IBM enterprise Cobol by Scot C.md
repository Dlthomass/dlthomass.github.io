The return email should direct them to this site:
https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/

and instruct them to (or suggest they) download the class instruction manual (materials):
<https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/blob/master/COBOL%20Programming%20with%20VSCode.md>

[No longer available: https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/blob/master/COBOL%20Programming%20with%20VSCode.pdf open with Acrobat Reader - has been removed]

I think what is happening, is people have found out about this course via all sorts of different methods, and there is no one place that has all of the above needed information. The return email would be a good place (although not the only place) where such information should/could be found.

Really enjoying the course and the Cobol Community that you have formed!
Keep up the good work!

Thank you,
